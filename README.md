# CSE564_Visualization_Lab1
Developed D3.js based visual interface using Python, JavaScript, D3.js, HTML, and CSS. Created different charts - Barchart/Histogram, Scatterplot to analyze the various attributes of the FIFA22 dataset as a part of course CSE 564 Visualization.

Your D3-based visual interface should be able to (10 pts each):
1. present a menu to allow users to select a variable and update chart
2. draw a bar chart if a categorical variable is selected
3. draw a histogram if a numerical variable is selected (bin it into a fixed range (equi-width) of your choice)
4. add a toggle button that selects whether the chart is drawn upright or sideways (see right)
5. produce a scatterplot of two selected variables (use a radio button to determine which of the two variable axes is to be loaded)
